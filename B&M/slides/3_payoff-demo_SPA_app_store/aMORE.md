You heard of 'mobile-first'.

Web app marketing /discovery:

* SEO
* AMP
* Blog/Writing - You may should have a 'writer' on staff.
* App Store
* UX / FX make it sticky.
* i18n


Much cheaper to do hybrid cross platform. You can't have one IOS developer, you need 2 for back up, and same for Android. With cross platform development, you just removed 4 FTE.

* Application logic is client side
Above line will hit you later.
