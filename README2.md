## Part II Cordova.


1.
You'll need a build machine in the cloud. A few places that offer OSX hosting: http://macminicolo.net , http://macstadium.com , http://macincloud.com but there are others.
OSX is required for IOS (due to dev keys) and easier to do Andorid with Genymotion emulator.
Install Xcode with IOS emaulator, Andorid SDK, Genymotion.


		npm i -g cordova


2.

For IOS app store you need to register with Apple as a developer (~$99/year) and apply. Application takes 48 hours to a week. You can then generate a key.


3.

In www/js index to go to deployed PWA app url in the cloud from README1.


4.

In theory 'build.phonegap.com' can supplement your Cordova build.
