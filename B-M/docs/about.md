# About MetaBake

MetaBake.org is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster then legacy development stacks/methodologies. We have found that - with MetaBake.org; - the work of 6 developers over 6 months can be done by 3 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


#### MetaBake.org productivity is based on three modules:

- nBake, a static site generation tool that runs locally
- B-M-SPA, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster
- Meta, a bespoke cloud-based build and admin app infrastructure that helps deliver functionality to your clients more quickly

We benchmark against _LAMP_, _RAILS_, _MEAN_ and such For example, LAMP is the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so technology gets 10 times better, which *forces* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C/.js is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, server-side rendered LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WordPress having some 30% of the World Wide Web. It is time to start displacing that.

You can reinvest the time saved by using MetaBake into a more interactive user experience (UX). Better UX is proven to lead into higher user engagement and better user retention.

# About B&M SPA

This section is about _B-M-SPA_, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster. It assume that you are familiar with the nBake project, as it builds on it. If you are not familiar with nBake, please go to [nBake Docs](http://doc.MetaBake.org/nbake) and review.

This project is named B-M-SPA for "Bricks, Mortar and Single-Page Applications". It contains building blocks for dynamic apps and mobile apps, and points at ways to to put them together. Writing a good SPA is the high art of app development - it is certainly a bit harder than writing regular webpages. If properly done - using Phonegap version 8+ - you can use a SPA as the core of a hybrid/cross-platform Appstore app (iOS and Android) without loss of native capabilities such as device permissions.
