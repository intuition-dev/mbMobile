## Part II phonegap.

0. You must have a PWA/SPA web app in the cloud before this step.


In your browser, open the file, don't use http server!!!!
    /www/index.html


1.
You'll need a build machine in the cloud. A few places that offer OSX hosting: http://macstadium.com , http://macincloud.com but there are others.
OSX is required for IOS (due to dev keys) and easier to do Andorid with Genymotion emulator.
Install Xcode with IOS emulator, Andorid SDK, Genymotion.


		npm i -g phonegap


2.

For IOS app store you need to register with Apple as a developer (~$99/year) and apply. Application takes 48 hours to a week. You can then generate a key.


3.

In www/js index to go to deployed spa app url in the cloud from README1.


4.

In theory 'build.phonegap.com' can supplement your phonegap build.
