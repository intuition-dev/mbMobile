# SPA-router

SPA/spa is good for native/hybrid/cross platform app store, Apple and Android.
Games are done like this 'hybrid cross platform'.

Here we have a .js router, similar to crossroads.js, called SPA-router.
It is in SPA/www/router folder.

If you don't like that router, we also support Framework7, SmoothSate or other similar SPA approaches.

You'll have to know some 'app shell' basics.
The router will replace the content in the page, but only the 'main' part, tagged w/ #router.


Before starting App store, realize that SPA is a bit harder than regular webpages. If you are new to SPA, it will be hard to jump into PhoneGap.
