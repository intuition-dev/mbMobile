## Meta&reg; with Docker admin, give you 10X better web app development productivity. For example, when we went from 2nd GL to 3GL. It includes an admin/build server, selected tech stack and a recommended software development management methodology. So work of 5 devs in 6 months can be done by 2 devs in 3 weeks.

This is project 2 of 3 Meta&reg;
# SPA-router

 You should expect that SPA is a bit harder than regular webpages.
SPA/spa is great for native/hybrid/cross platform app store, Apple and Android.
Even games are done like via Phonegap version 8, a 'hybrid cross platform'. Some old version was slow on old IOS/Android.

In this project we have a .js router, similar to crossroads.js, called SPA-router.
Source is in SPA/www/router folder.

If you don't like this router here, we also support Framework7, SmoothState or other similar SPA approaches.

You'll have to know some 'app shell' basics.
The router will replace the content in the page, but only the 'main' part, tagged w/ #router.

### Lab/Demo:


		nbake -p

		Un-Comment line 60 in the SPA app, www/assets/js/SPAsetup.js and deploy to a mounted http server.
		Run in browser as SPA web app.
