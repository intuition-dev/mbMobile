### METAbake&trade; is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster than on a LAMP stack. We have found that - with METAbake&trade; - the work of 5 developers over 3 months can be done by 2 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


This is project 2 of 3 Meta&reg;
# SPA-router

 You should expect that SPA is a bit harder than regular webpages.
SPA/spa is great for native/hybrid/cross platform app store, Apple and Android.
Even games are done like via Phonegap version 8, a 'hybrid cross platform'. Some old version was slow on old IOS/Android.

In this project we have a .js router, similar to crossroads.js, called SPA-router.
Source is in SPA/www/router folder.

If you don't like this router here, we also support Framework7, SmoothState or other similar SPA approaches.

You'll have to know some 'app shell' basics.
The router will replace the content in the page, but only the 'main' part, tagged w/ #router.

### Lab/Demo:

		nbake -p

		Deploy to a mounted http server in the cloud(Ex: CDN77, S3)
		Run in browser as SPA web app.

		Un-Comment line 60 in the SPA app, www/assets/js/SPAsetup.js and run again.

This is just so you are comfortable editing, notice that app is loading deployed resources.
