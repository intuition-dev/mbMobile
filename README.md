This is project 2 of 3 in in METAbake&trade;. This Github project is about _B-M-SPA_, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster.

This project is named B-M-SPA for "Bricks, Mortar and Single-Page Applications". It contains building blocks for dynamic apps and mobile apps, and points at ways to to put them together. Writing a good SPA is the high art of app development - it is certainly a bit harder than writing regular webpages. If properly done - using Phonegap version 8+ - you can use a SPA as the core of a hybrid/cross-platform Appstore app (iOS and Android) without loss of native capabilities such as device permissions.
